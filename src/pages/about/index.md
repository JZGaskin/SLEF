Somerset Little Eagle Football & Cheer participates in the Laurel Highlands Developmental Football League ([LHDFL](http://lhdfl.com/)). We have tackle football teams at grade levels 1-6 with a season beginning in August and ending in October. 



## MISSION

Our mission is to provide high level developmental football and cheer programs. 



## OBJECTIVES

To encourage and increase youth participation in football and cheer.

To ensure a safe and positive playing environment for all participants.

To instill life-long values of teamwork, dedication and a superior work ethic in the classroom and on the playing field.

## 

## VOLUNTEERS

We are an "all volunteer" organization and have many dedicated members who meet monthly throughout the year to make sure our season runs smoothly for all involved. Throughout the season we will ask, and appreciate those, individuals that step up for jobs that make this all work.



## COACHES

Our coaches are dedicated to the mission of the organization and spend tremendous time developing the skills necessary for the season and beyond. Collaborations with the varsity program and time spent in educational clinics ensure that our coaches are passing on the latest and safest skills. All coaches are required to have recent clearances, including child abuse and criminal background certificates, and complete concussion awareness training.
